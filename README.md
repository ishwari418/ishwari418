# Hi, I’m Ishwari 👋  

I’m a **Computer Science (AI & ML) student** who enjoys building practical AI systems that actually work — not just models that look good in notebooks.

I’m especially interested in **LLM-based applications, intelligent backends, and data-driven tools** that solve real problems.

## 👩‍💻 What I Work On
- Designing and building **AI-powered applications**
- Exploring **LLMs, NLP, and knowledge-based systems**
- Turning ideas into **end-to-end projects** with clean logic and usable interfaces  
- Learning how real systems are designed, deployed, and improved  

I care more about **clarity and impact** than buzzwords.
